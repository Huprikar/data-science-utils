## Grasping Machine Learning with Mathematical Theory â€” Resources

Or a Bag of resources for ML and maths in ML

With the advent of multiple libraries machine learning work has been democratised in a big way. Its easy to now build your own model following a tutorial. But what remains missing is our ability to dive into research and contribute to solving harder problems. To be able to apply ML algorithms to novel situations we need to understand how they work and where they are suited.

This type of deep understanding of ML algorithms can be achieved by knowing the fundamentals, not just by using library APIs. As such this guide is focused on providing the fundamental resources on mathematics and machine learning to help us move forward.

Understanding some CS basics before starting ML is very useful. Learn Python programming too.

Install using `sudo gem install markdown_helper` then in this folder run `markdown_helper include readme_template.md readme.md`

In my suggestion having 2 parallel threads, 1 on ML and 1 on Maths is best. Studying only mathematics will become monotonous, ML study and practice is essential since our goal is to gain deeper understanding of ML. For working on ML try combining theory and also do some practice challenges on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
